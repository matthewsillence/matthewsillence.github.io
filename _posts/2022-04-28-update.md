This week's announcement that Elon Musk has agreed a [takeover deal](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/25/twitter-elon-musk-buy-takeover-deal-tesla) with Twitter has prompted questions over the future of the social media platform. Personally, I find Twitter very helpful in my professional life, but I have reservations about Musk's control of the platform. Decentralized, open-source alternatives, such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), provide better models for information exchange and community ownership, and I hope that these options become more widespread in the social media ecosystem. 

For the foreseeable future, I will continue to use [@UEA_HUMGrad](https://twitter.com/UEA_HUMGrad) as the official site for departmental work, but @MSill1 will be deactivated this week. My online presence will continue in the following locations:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewsillence/)
- [matthewsillence.org](https://matthewsillence.blogspot.com/)
- [UEA Research Portal](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/matthew-sillence)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/matthewsillence)

I am grateful to all my followers - friends, colleagues, staff and students - who have made the experience such a positive one for me. I respect any individual's decision to continue on Twitter, and hope that it has been as beneficial for you as it has been for me.
