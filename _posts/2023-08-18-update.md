Having spent several months working with markdown (.md) format and files, I have relocated my blog to be hosted through GitHub pages. The domain [matthewsillence.org](https://matthewsillence.org) will automatically redirect to this site, and the historic posts from [matthewsillence.blogspot.com](https://matthewsillence.blogspot.com/) will be imported into the new site.
