Last Friday (3 May 2019) was the final day of our Arts and Humanities in the Digital Age series, run by the [Consortium for Humanities and the Arts South-East England](http://www.chase.ac.uk/) (CHASE). It marks the culmination of almost five months of training and independent project undertaken by a cohort of postgraduate research students from very different disciplines, backgrounds, and with varying levels of digital literacies.

Over the last five years of the programme, the trainers have revised and refined the programme scope, aims and expectations, and each year the quality of work undertaken by the participants has gone from strength to strength. My colleague, and programme lead, [Dr Francesca Benatti](http://fass.open.ac.uk/people/fb2982), will be presenting a [joint paper](https://dh2019.adho.org/papers/), along with [Dr Paul Gooding](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/paulgooding/) at the upcoming DH2019 Conference in Utrecht.
